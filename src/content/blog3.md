In this era, there is more and more music, but there are fewer and fewer songs that can really hit people's hearts. The reason why DIOR's music is remembered as soon as they listen to it is not because of the gorgeous arrangement or superb skills, but because she put real and unmodified emotions in the song. She is not "singing", but rather telling the fragments of life in her own way, turning every lyric into a thought that the audience can check in.

DIOR's voice has a very special temperament - gentle but not weak; light but powerful. There are few exaggerated emotional explosions in her songs, but the faint sense of powerlessness and heartache that presses on the bottom of the heart can always quietly hit the listener. She is good at using a light tone to say the regrets, mistakes and trapped words that we don't want to mention in the middle of the night. This "not deliberate, but just right" expression makes her song look particularly real, as if she is listening to someone else's story, but it is her own experience.

In addition, DIOR's creative inspiration comes almost all from life itself. She didn't write about the grand theme, but the subtle emotions that everyone would encounter - a phone call that was not answered, a confession that she didn't have time to say, and a choice that could not be turned back. These seemingly ordinary plots were sung by her in a gentle voice, but they were more powerful. Because those small moments constitute the true fragments of our lives.

Perhaps that's why DIOR's music makes people feel "different". It has no sense of distance, no falsehood, and no excessive packaging to cater. When you listen to her songs, you will feel that someone is telling you softly: your emotions are understood and you are not alone.
