The first time I met DIOR was on a seemingly ordinary night that became very special in my memory. That day, I let the playlist loop casually, and the headphones kept switching different songs, and I didn't pay much attention to it. Until the prelude of "If That Phone is connected" sounded, the calm and emotional melody suddenly made me stop the movement of my hand. What really made me settle down was the first sentence she said - no exaggeration, no skilful show-off, but with a deep helplessness and tenderness, as if someone sighed softly in the dark night, but pretended that everything was okay.

At that time, I only thought that this song could "understand me" so much. The unspeakable heartache, the regret that can't be kept, and the sense of powerlessness that can't be delivered are all sung by her very realistically. I began to think: Who is this? How can there be such a voice that wraps the subtle emotions in life in such a simple way, but it is so heartbreaking?

SO I WENT TO CHECK HER NAME - DIOR. A small town girl from Batu Pahat, Malysia, starting from the cover, wrote songs little by little with her own experience. Perhaps it is because her life is very ordinary that she can sing the most ordinary feelings in a way that resonates. She is not the kind of singer who shocks the audience as soon as she opens her mouth, but her voice has a quiet power, as if gently accompanying everyone who has experienced similar things.

Later, I found that the reason why "If That Phone Call is Connected" touches people is that it is not as exaggerated as other love songs, but like the moments that each of us has experienced - the missed call, the words that could not be said, and those regrets that can never be turned back. It was these truths that made me really remember DIOR for the first time.After that day, her name became warm in my heart. I'm not amazed, but understood. From the moment I met DIOR, her music has become a part of my life. </details>
