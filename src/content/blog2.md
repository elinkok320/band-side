In celebration of her 5th anniversary since her debut, the songstress is set to hold her very first concert, “Kampung Girl: Ordinary People”, at the end of the year. This milestone is not only the realisation of her dream, but also a way for her to share her personal story through music—bringing the most genuine version of herself to the audience.

From her humble beginnings in a small town to standing on the grand stage, the singer hopes her journey will inspire every “ordinary person” to persevere with courage and determination. “I’ve always believed that the most touching stories come from the most ordinary people. That’s exactly what the theme of this concert, ‘Kampung Girl: Ordinary People,’ is meant to convey,” she said.

The concert will take fans on an intimate journey through her life. For Diorlying, this is not only a personal dream come true but also a heartfelt tribute to her late mother. She has shared that her mother always wished to see her shine on stage one day, and “Kampung Girl: Ordinary People” is the best way to fulfil that wish.
